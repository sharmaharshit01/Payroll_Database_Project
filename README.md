# Payroll_Database_Project

I have developed payroll management project in MySQL.
I created several tables like Employee, Department, Account_Details, Salary, Leaves, Work_Location, Project and Attendence tables.
Also created Department_Project & Employee_Attendance tables which are being used to store the foreign keys to link to different tables.

I developed insert queries to store data which is related to the payroll systems. 
Then, I wrote my own use cases based on the the table structure and data by fetching records through select queries.
Some examples are like calculating highest salaried employee, employees who have taken multiple leaves in the same month, etc.
